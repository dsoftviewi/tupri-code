<h1>Privacy Policy </h1>
<p>dvi.co.in respects your privacy and recognizes the need to   protect the personally identifiable information (any information by   which you can be identified, such as name, address and telephone number)   you share with us. We would like to assure you that we follow   appropriate standards when it comes to protecting your privacy on our   web sites.</p>
<p>Some of our web pages use &quot;cookies&quot; so that we can better serve you   with customized information when you return to our site.

The information we collect and   analyze is used to improve our service to you. </p>
<p>There are times when we may collect personal information from you   such as name, physical address or telephone number. It is our intent to   inform you before we do that and to tell you what we intend to do with   the information.
